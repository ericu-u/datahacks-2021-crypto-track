# datahacks-2021-crypto-track
 
This project is a submission for the Cryptocurrency Transactions track in Datahacks 2021 (UCSD). Team members include Justin Liang and Jonathan Lo.

In this project, we were provided a dataset containing observations of transactions using cryptocurrency. The `label` column represents the label, where "white" is a legal transaction and anything else is the ransomware used in the transaction. Some provided features included the bitcoin address, number of loops, etc., and we explained them more in depth in the pdf report.

The main goal of the project was to generate some data visualizations that help explain relationships in the data, perform hypothesis testing, and to create a predictive model that can predict the label of an observation.
